## In this dir are the scripts used by i3blocks.
##Â files in this dir are those I modified for my own needs. Defaults scripts are stored in the default_scripts dir,
## and I just create symlinks here so i3blocks can find all scripts in just one dir.

## Thus, I exclude symlinks (ie defaults scripts) (with the following command : "find ./ -maxdepth 1 -type l") :

temperature
openvpn
wifi
cpu_usage
keyindicator
bandwidth
disk
mediaplayer
load_average
memory
volume
!default_scripts/*
